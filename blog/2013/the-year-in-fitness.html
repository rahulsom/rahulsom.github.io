<p>2012 had been a fairly successful year in some aspects. In some, it was terrible.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="cycling">Cycling</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had set a target of 1500 miles and was possibly very very short of this target.
A lot of things caused this - mostly my laziness.
However the good news was that I was able to get back to biking after my rather long hiatus after an accident.
Also I never did many 50 miles rides.
There was just one 50 mile ride.
Most rides were shorter, though they included some rides to Palomares.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best thing however was, I got closer to my ideal weight.
I got better average speeds.
I expanded my territory, i.e. got into mountain biking.
I did some rides in Skyline but several rides at Mission Peak.
Also my climb speed has improved a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For 2013, I want to revive my goal from 2012, i.e. 1500 miles on my road bike.
I have signed up for an 80 miler in May.
Also I want to pack in a few mountain rides.
And I want to buy my own mountain bike.
I&#8217;m looking at the <a href="http://reviews.mtbr.com/2013-specialized-camber">'13 Specialized Camber 29</a>.
Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was able to manage to start running.
It took a lot of effort, but I got comfortable with running ~10K.
The speed isn&#8217;t great, but it&#8217;s still something.
For 2013, I&#8217;m thinking of getting to do a half marathon.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took help from a personal trainer to get my shit straight.
And that was helpful.
If you need help with your fitness goals, do consider consulting a personal trainer.
You might think you don&#8217;t want to hulk up, and that&#8217;s fine, but having a trainer who knows what the hell they&#8217;re doing advise you is better than you trying to figure out how to reach your goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For 2013, my goal keep this going.
As a first hurdle, I seem to have screwed up my wrist, <em>again</em>.</p>
