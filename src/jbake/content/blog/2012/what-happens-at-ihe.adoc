At the crux of Healthcare IT, is a body called Integrating Healthcare Enterprise http://www.ihe.net/[(IHE)]. They are one of the standards bodies in healthcare.
They organize this little thing in Chicago every winter called http://www.ihe.net/connectathon/[Connectathon].

It is no secret that my opinion of healthcare technology is very bad.

Keep calm and carry on!

If you are into healthcare and want to talk to the nice folks from https://twitter.com/CertifyData[@CertifyData], we'll be there.
And if I may add, it'll be easy to find us.
