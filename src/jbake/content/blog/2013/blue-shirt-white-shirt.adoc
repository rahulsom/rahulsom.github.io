No! That is not Bob.

I call this the `Blue Shirt, White Shirt` problem. It goes like this:

Your customer, _Bob_ comes to your garage and says

'''''

_My car does not work._

_It's actually quite simple, and I figured out what makes it stop. 
When I wear a blue shirt, it works just fine. But when I wear a white
shirt, 
it doesn't work._

'''''

If you're a mechanic, you know there's some serious shit going on there,
but 
your customer has a hypothesis and you don't. Let's start looking into
this problem 
deeper.

'''''

_I woke up last morning and wore a blue shirt. Then I got to work._

_Then I came home. The car was still working. You with me?_

_I had to go to my buddy's place. So I quickly changed to a white
shirt, 
and tried starting my car. It just wouldn't._

_So I said "let's go back to my blue shirt". So I went back in, and
changed. 
I got a call from Mom, and minutes later I start the car, and it works
just 
fine._

_But I wanted to make sure I'm right so I also took my white shirt with
me 
to his place, and told him about this problem. He doubted me too. 
So I put on the white shirt and tried starting it, and it wouldn't
start._

_Then we went out for dinner in his car, and I spilled some of that Thai
Curry 
on my white shirt. So I had to change back to my blue shirt, because,
well anyways 
my car wouldn't start with the white shirt._

_Now I started the car, and came back home. But to be sure, I put on
another white 
shirt and tried starting the car. It just wouldn't._

_So this morning, I put on this green shirt, and drove to work.
Everything was great. 
I quickly changed to my white shirt, to show my coworker the problem,
and as expected 
the car wouldn't start._

_I decided to bring my car in around my lunch break._

_Let me quickly put on my white shirt and show you that I'm not making
things 
up._

'''''

Now _Bob_ has done an amazing analysis of the problem, and it's a great
story. 
The only problem with it is **it's all wrong**.

While having a diploma in car repair would help you trust my judgement
of this analysis, 
you probably know that any way.

A lot of customer problems in Software Development get reported this
way. And by the 
time they get to the developer who needs to fix the problem, this is
what it looks like

....
CAR-1034: Car does not start when customer is wearing white shirts.

Severity: Blocker
Type: Bug
....

What would have helped move things around is

....
CAR-1034: Investigate intermittent starting trouble on Bob's car.

Severity: Blocker
Type: Support Task
....

The amount of time wasted by development and QA in reproducing Bob's
"problem" is huge. 
Perhaps it might have been simpler to find out why Bob's car does not
start when the 
engine is already warm.
