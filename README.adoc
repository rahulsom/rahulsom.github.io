* The `source` branch contains the source files
* The `master` branch contains the result of baking.

== Building

This will run gradle in continuous mode and keep building the site in the `build/jbake` directory.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -t bake
----

In order to publish, run

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publish
----

In order to create a new post, run

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew createPost -Pfilename=some-file-name
----

That will create an asciidoctor file under the `src/jbake/content/<year>` directory with some content to start it up.
