* The `source` branch contains the source files
* The `master` branch contains the result of baking.

== Building

This will run gradle in continuous mode and keep building the site in the `build/jbake` directory.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -t bake
----

If you're on arm64, and can't get jbake to run, you can use this to dockerize the build.

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
    --rm \
    -v $HOME/.gradle:/root/.gradle \
    -v $PWD:/workspace \
    -w /workspace \
    azul/zulu-openjdk:21-latest \
        ./gradlew bake
----

In order to publish, run

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publish
----

In order to create a new post, run

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew createPost -Pfilename=some-file-name
----

That will create an asciidoctor file under the `src/jbake/content/<year>` directory with some content to start it up.
